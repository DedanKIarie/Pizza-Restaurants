##  Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8+
- pipenv (for dependency management)
- Git (for version control)

##  Setup and Installation

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DedanKIarie/Pizza-Restaurants
cd Pizza-Restaurants
```

### 2. Create Virtual Environment and Install Dependencies

This project uses `pipenv` for clean dependency management:

```bash
# Install all required packages from Pipfile
pipenv install

# Activate the virtual environment
pipenv shell
```

### 3. Database Setup

Run these commands from the root directory (`Pizza-Restaurants/`) to set up your database:

> **Important:** Your application directory is named `Server` (with a capital 'S'). Commands are case-sensitive.

```bash
# Set the FLASK_APP environment variable
export FLASK_APP="Server.app:create_app"

# Initialize migrations (run only once)
flask db init

# Generate initial migration script
flask db migrate -m "Create initial tables"

# Apply migrations to create database tables
flask db upgrade
```

### 4. Seed the Database

Populate your database with sample data:

```bash
python -m Server.seed
```

### 5. Start the Development Server

```bash
flask run
```

 **Your API is now running at:** `http://127.0.0.1:5000`
